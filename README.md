# Rita-Jenny-Transit-Project
#Project Description
This project focuses on discussing the relationship between ridership and gas price, with a main focus on bus routes and ridership in the Twin Cities area.

# Downloading the Project
To download the project, including the dataset, you can directly download the file called "multiple_plot_with_leaflet_demo", which includes all four datasets we used in the final visualization, as well as the Shiny app file with a description.

# Running the Shiny App
To run the Shiny app, including the leaflet map and Plotly graph, you will need to install the following packages in R: `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, `DT`, `shinyWidgets`, `rgdal`, `leaflet`, `raster`, `dplyr`, `sf`, `tidyverse`, `plotly`, and `lubridate`.

# Model Files
If you are interested in the models such as the linear regression model and the time series model, you can download the two RMD files called "model_1" and "model_2", which include all data cleaning processes and the models. To run the models, you will need to install the following packages in R: `dbplyr`, `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `readr`, `geeM`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `broom`, `ggplot2`, `stringr`, `splines`, `astsa`, and `zoo`.

# Other Files
All other folders and files are testing demos and templates, and you can browse them if you are interested.

# Authors
This project was created by Rita Li and Jenny Li in 2022. Rita focused on data cleaning and models, while Jenny focused on the Shiny app and paper work.
